filematch
=========

Over time my family has amassed a large collection of digital photos.  The only problem is that sometimes images or whole folders of images get copied around and we're left lots of duplicate images.

So more as an exercise for me to start learning C# than an attempt to create a real application, I came up with the code here.

### Usage

_Currently the code is set up to find only duplicate jpg files._

* Select your directory
* Choose if you want to match within all subdirectories
* Click on the big button and wait a while (a long while if it's a lot of images!)
* Review the duplicate files in the tree and right-click to open the folder location or delete the image (deleting an image will send it to the recycle bin)

### Feedback

As this is starting out from me knowing absolutely nothing about C# or Visual Studio, any feedback you have is much appreciated - please feel free to fork and comment!
